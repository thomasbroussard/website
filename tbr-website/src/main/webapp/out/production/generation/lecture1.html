        <h2>Before we start...</h2>

        <p>Hello everyone, my name is <b>Thomas Broussard</b>. I thought it could be the minimum to introduce myself, as
            we will stay at least 15 hours together</p>

        <p>I will be your java teacher during the next semester. I've practised java for 5 year and I'm actually the
            technical project manager of my business unit</p>
