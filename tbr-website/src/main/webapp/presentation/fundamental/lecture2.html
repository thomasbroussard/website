        <h2>Review of the last lecture</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>We approximately defined the object concept</li>
            <li>We've tried to design an application diagram in order to share its functioning with other developers
            </li>
            <li>It has been difficult to find a way to express ideas in a standard way, while designing the schemas
                representing the application
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

<section class="slide">
    <div>
        <h2>What we need as programmers : general needs</h2>

        <p>Basically, the utmost need is to be able to communicate in a professional environment</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We need a common vocabulary</li>
            <li>We need a standard diagramming "language"</li>
            <li>We have to stay not to far from the technical aspect, say stay concrete</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</section>
<section class="slide">
    <div>
        <h2>What we need as programmers : diagramming needs</h2>

        <div>In OOP (and almost in any kind of programming), we have to cover three types of diagram:</div>
        <ul>
            <li>The general application lifecycle : the <strong>Activity Diagram</strong></li>
            <li>The description of the application technical entities (Classes) : the <strong>Class Diagram</strong>
            </li>
            <li>A diagram showing the usage of the application parts by human participants : the <strong>Use Case
                Diagram</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</section>
<section class="slide">
    <div>
        <h2>Solution matching our needs: UML</h2>

        <div>UML allows to give an answer to each of these needs</div>
        <ul>
            <li>It defines a standardized <strong>vocabulary</strong></li>
            <li>UML gives <strong>predefined semantic shapes</strong>, in several diagramming categories</li>
            <li>UML is a <strong>diagramming tool</strong>, so it can be understood by non-developer people</li>
            <li>It is a <strong>language</strong> so it can be used by or be generated by other language applications
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</section>
<section class="slide">
    <div>
        <h2>UML: Class diagrams</h2>

        <div>The class diagram allows to show the class organization, how they <strong>depend</strong> between each
            other, what are their
            interactions, etc.
        </div>
        <div>
            This brings these questions:
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>How to define and represent an object regarding the UML syntax?</li>
            <li>What can be the interactions between the several objects of an
                application ?
            </li>
        </ul>

    </div>
</section>
<section class="slide">
    <div>
        <h2>Class definition : properties</h2>

        <div>The first description of a real "object" is a factual description, with an enumeration of each <strong>property</strong>
            of that object
        </div>
        <div>This property set is also called <strong>fields</strong> of that object</div>
        <div>The dog object example</div>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="../../images/svg/oop-dog-properties.svg"/>
        </div>

    </div>
</section>
<section class="slide">
    <div>
        <h2>Class interactions : Messages and methods</h2>

        <div>The most basic interaction with an object is to send a <strong>message</strong> (an instruction) to it
            in order for this object to perform an operation.
        </div>


        <div>To be able to receive and to treat this message, this object has to have a <strong>method</strong>
            corresponding to this message
        </div>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="../../images/svg/oop-dog.svg"/>
        </div>

    </div>
</section>
<section class="slide">
    <div>
        <h2>Class interactions : Exercise</h2>

        <div>Remember our contact phone book? use the class diagram to represent each class, without representing their
            interaction
        </div>
    </div>
</section>
<section class="slide">
    <div>
        <h2>Class interactions : relations between classes</h2>

        <div>In UML each class relation is represented by a specific "link"
        </div>

        <div>What are the different relations?</div>
    </div>
</section>
<section class="slide">
    <div>
        <h2>Class interactions : Association</h2>

        <div>An association between two classes is symbolized by a link between those two classes
        </div>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="../../images/svg/oop-accounts.svg"/>
        </div>


    </div>
</section>
<section class="slide">
    <div>
        <h2>Class interactions : Association(2)</h2>

        <div>An association has a <strong>cardinality</strong>, indicating how many object references the association is
            concerning
        </div>
        <div>This should be read as: <em>"An account can have up to two owners, and a person can have several
            accounts"</em></div>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="../../images/svg/oop-accounts.svg"/>
        </div>

    </div>

<section class="slide">
    <div>
        <h2>Class interactions : Aggregation </h2>

        <div>An aggregation is the fact for a class to be <strong>composed</strong> with an other class</div>
        <div>There are 2 types of aggregation</div>
        <ul>
            <li>The weak aggregation</li>
            <li>The composition</li>
        </ul>

    </div>
</section>
<section class="slide">
    <div>
        <h2>Class interactions : the Weak Aggregation </h2>

        <div>A good example of a weak aggregation is the association between a Playlist and the Tracks of that
            playlist
        </div>
        <div><strong>Exercise : </strong> define the cardinality of the Playlist - Track association</div>

    </div>
</section>
<section class="slide">
    <div>
        <h2>Class interactions : the Weak Aggregation (2) </h2>

        <div>The weak aggregation is when:</div>
        <ul>
            <li>The composed class can share its components with other composed class</li>
            <li>The composed class has a reference to its components</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="../../images/svg/oop-weak-aggregation.svg"/>
        </div>
    </div>
</section>
<section class="slide">
    <div>
        <h2>The Weak Aggregation (3) </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The schema above represents that an Email can be "aggregated" with a File</li>
            <li>The aggregation is weak because the Email and the File lifecycles <strong>are not linked</strong></li>
            <li>The "aggregated" object can be used by <strong>several other objects</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="../../images/svg/oop-weak-aggregation.svg"/>

    </div>
</section>
<section class="slide">
    <div>
        <h2>Class interactions : the Composition link</h2>

        <div>The composition is a sort of aggregation where the <strong>composite</strong> and the
            <strong>component</strong> objects are strongly linked
        </div>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="../../images/svg/oop-composition.svg"/>
        </div>

    </div>
</section>
<section class="slide">
    <div>
        <h2>Class interactions : the Composition link</h2>

        <div>The composition is a sort of aggregation where the <strong>composite</strong> and the
            <strong>component</strong> objects are strongly linked
        </div>
        <div>The composition link implies that :</div>
        <ul>
            <li>the component object is attached to only one composite</li>
            <li>The destruction of the composite implies the destruction of all component objects</li>
        </ul>
        <div>In general, the aggregation link is known as the <strong>HAS-A</strong> relationship</div>
    </div>

<section class="slide">
    <div>
        <h2>Class Hierarchy</h2>
        <ul>

            <li>The class hierarchy represents the fact that several object can share the same characteristics

            </li>
            <li>This description is very close to the species <strong>inheritance</strong> description
            </li>
            <li>
                This relationship can be represented through this sentence :
                <div style="text-align: center">
                    <p></p>
                    <cite>"<em>A <strong>Wolf</strong> is a <strong>QuadrupedMammal</strong>, a
                        <strong>QuadrupedMammal</strong> is a
                        <strong>Mammal</strong></em>"</cite>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</section>
<section class="slide">
    <div>
        <h2>Class Hierarchy (2)</h2>

        <div>The inheritance mechanism is very useful to factor the common properties and methods shared by several
            objects
        </div>
        <div>The inheritance is also known as the <strong>"IS-A"</strong> relationship</div>
        <div>The previous sentence can be represented as follows</div>
        <div class="img-container">

        <h2>Class Hierarchy (3)
            <div>Specialization vs Generalization</div>
        </h2>
        <div>You can read the diagram from right to left, in this way the description is called
            <strong>Generalization</strong></div>
        <div>In the other way, you start from a general Object and you finish on a specific one, this is called <strong>Specialization</strong>
        </div>
        <hr/>
        <div>When you specialize an object, the result object owns all the characteristics of its
            <strong>super-class</strong> plus its own characteristics
