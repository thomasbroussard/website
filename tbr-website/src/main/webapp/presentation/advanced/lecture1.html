        <h2>Before we start...</h2>

        <p>Hello everyone, my name is <strong>Thomas Broussard</strong>. I thought it could be the minimum to introduce
            myself, as
            we will stay at least 21 hours together</p>

        <p>I will be your java teacher during the next semester. To sum up my experience in Java, I've practised java
            for 5 year and I'm actually the
            technical project manager of my business unit</p>

        <ul>
            <li class="next">This course is structured in <strong>9</strong> levels</li>
            <li class="next">During this semester, we will see <strong>6</strong> of these levels.</li>
            <li class="next">Assuming you've already done the first semester, you've already done the 3 previous
                levels
            </li>
            <li class="next">The main goal of this course is to stay away from pure theoretical knowledge to focus on
                practical skills
            </li>

            <li class="next">You will have a project to submit at the end of that course</li>
            <li class="next">The balance is <strong>25%</strong> for the test and <strong>75%</strong> for the project

        <h2>Now, let's start :
            Design patterns and Java
        </h2>

        <p>Design patterns : <strong>What?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li class="next">Design patterns are reusable architectures, bringing all-made solutions to a given
                problem
            </li>
            <li class="next">Using a design pattern must be studied : misapplication can cause severe productivity
                problems
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</section>
<section class="slide">
    <div>
        <h2>Design patterns : <strong>Why?</strong></h2>

        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li class="next">The usage of design patterns is not always needed, but...</li>
            <li class="next">It can slightly make the difference, especially when you work with other people</li>
            <li class="next">Indeed, the vocabulary is precise, and standard (it helps other to know directly what you
                tried to do)
            </li>
            <li class="next">These patterns are very used in the software companies, so knowing them can help you to
                enter in a complex architecture
            </li>
            <li class="next">These patterns can apply in many other languages</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</section>
<section class="slide">
    <div>
        <h2>Design patterns : Categories</h2>

        <div>There are several kind of patterns, each of them answering to a specific need</div>
        <ul>
            <li class="next"><strong>Creational patterns</strong> help you to handle the creation of objects</li>
            <li class="next"><strong>Structural patterns</strong> help you to handle to increase the abilities of
                objects in a sustainable way
            </li>
            <li class="next"><strong>Behaviour patterns</strong> help you to optimize communications and cross usage of
                objects
            </li>
            <li class="next"><strong>Concurrency patterns</strong> help you to optimize the way concurrency is managed
                in your program
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</section>
<section class="slide">
    <div>
        <h2>Creational patterns</h2>

        <div>These patterns have in common the creation of objects, first example <strong>The Factory Pattern</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="../../images/png/dp-factory.png"/>
        </div>

    </div>
</section>
<section class="slide">
    <div>
        <h2>Factory pattern : Exercise</h2>

        <div>Take your old java project and implement a factory pattern allowing to create identity objects from jdbc or
            xml.
        </div>
    </div>
</section>
<section class="slide">
    <div>
        <h2>Object Pool: Definition</h2>

        <div>The object pool pattern helps you to realize the initialization of a configured amount of objects, which
            are particularly heavy to set up.
        </div>
        <div>It can be for example, a connection to a DataBase</div>
    </div>

</section>
<section class="slide">

    <h2>Schema : Pool acquisition sequence</h2>

    <div class="img-container">
        <img class="wide" src="../../images/png/dp_objectpool.png"/>
    </div>

</section>
<section class="slide">
    <div>
        <h2>The Strategy Pattern</h2>

        <div>The strategy pattern helps you to update the behaviour of your program, under certain condition</div>
        <div><strong>Example</strong></div>
        <ul>
            <li>You try to access to a remote database which does not respond</li>
            <li>If you don't have a fall back, you cannot record the user-input</li>
            <li>Solution, change your record <strong>strategy</strong> to handle the database failure</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</section>
<section class="slide">
    <div>
        <h2>Exercise</h2>

        <div>Implement the previously described case to switch your Data Access Strategy in case of database access
            failure
        </div>
    </div>

        <h2>Assignment</h2>

        <p>Find a design pattern that seems interesting in this <a href="http://www.oodesign.com">web site</a> and
            implement it in your project</p>
